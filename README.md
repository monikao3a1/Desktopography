# Desktopography
The aim of this project is to turn any projection into a touch screen. It works by using a depth camera to figure out the distance of the hands from the screen and when the hand is close enough to the projection, it maps the hand position to the actual projection and uses PyAutoGUI to allow the user to touch or drag things.
